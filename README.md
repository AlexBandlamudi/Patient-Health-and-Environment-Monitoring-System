# Patient-Health-and-Environment-Monitoring-System

### In today’s digital and fast paced world, the intersection of Digital technology and Health care is crucial for the development of various innovative health care systems. The convergence of healthcare and environment monitoring has created a whole new chapter for comprehensive assessment of the patient. This paper introduces a novel and innovative device that seamlessly amalgamates patient health data with real time environment data. The device is triggered by a ultrasonic sensor for effortless present selection. The device incorporates state of the art sensors, that includes Max30102 Heart rate sensor,MLX90614 body temperature sensor, DHT11 for monitoring temperature and humidity, BMP180 pressure sensor, with NodeMCU microcontroller as its core component. This paper presents the architecture, implementation, and outcomes of the PHES and also highlights its potential to reshape the health care practices. The biomedical data that is obtained from the device is transmitted to the cloud in realtime. The “Blynk” cloud platform is utilized to monitor and store the information. In this way the paramedical staff/specialist can analyze and monitor the data anywhere as long as they have access to the cloud platform.

### The entire code is in the final.ino file.

### components required are : Ultrasonic sensor, 16x2 LCD display, I2C module, DHT11 sensor, BMP180 sensor,  MAX30102 Heartrate sensor, MLX90614 Infrared temperature sensor
